        <h2 class="main-feature-title"><strong>Double-entry Bookkeeping</strong></h2>
        <p>Since the 1500s, accounting and bookkeeping have followed the practice of<strong> Double-entry Bookkeeping.</strong> It implies that every entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account. The double-entry has two equal and corresponding sides known as debit and credit. The left-hand side is debit while the right-hand side is credit. <br><br>For instance, recording a sale of $100 might require two entries: a debit of $100 to an account named &quot;Cash&quot; and a credit of $100 to an account named &quot;Revenue.&quot;<br><br><strong>Assets = Equities + Liabilities<br><br></strong>The accounting equation is an error detection tool; if at any point the sum of debits for all accounts does not equal the corresponding sum of credits for all accounts, an error has occurred. However, satisfying the equation does not guarantee that there are no errors; the ledger may still &quot;balance&quot; even if the wrong ledger accounts have been debited or credited.<br></p>

        <h2 class="main-feature-title"><strong>Triple Entry Accounting</strong></h2>
        <p>Triple entry accounting has an enhancement over the conventional system as all the accounting entries involving outside parties that are cryptographically sealed by a third entry. These may include purchases of inventory and supplies, sales, tax and utility payments, and other expenses. The bookkeeping entries of both parties are placed beside each other to ensure that the given transaction is congruent. A seller books debit to account for cash received, and a buyer books a credit for cash spent in the same transaction, however, in separate sets of accounting records. This is where blockchain and DLTs come in: rather than these entries occurring separately in independent sets of books, they occur in the form of a transfer between individual ledgers of the two parties that reflect in the same distributed public ledger, creating an interlocking system of enduring accounting records. Since the entries are distributed and cryptographically sealed, their immutability and transparency are assured.</p>

      <div class="section-description">Aurigraph DLT offers real-time reconciliation and audits across multiple ledgers while reducing the effort and cost of executing the same. Unlike conventional double-entry bookkeeping, Aurigraph DLT offers reconciliation not just among pairs of ledgers but also value chains that will have a combination of transactions like splitting, merging, returns and reversals of transactions. Transactions requiring splitting, merging and returns in a sequence of transactions becomes very tedious to track and trace the details and reconcile multiple hops of the transaction. Moreover, commercial transactions with incumbent transaction amounts and taxes have multiple splitting, merging and returning of goods and services.</div>

            <p>A “<strong>Forward</strong>” transaction is one in which the operating node sends multiple transactions as a single transaction to the next recipient. For example, Company A sends 100 pieces of a component to Company B, thus “sending” the components to the next stakeholder in the value chain.</p>
          </div>
          <div data-w-tab="Tab 2" class="process-tab-pane w-tab-pane">
            <p>A “<strong>Return</strong>” transaction is one in which the operating node returns a received transaction to the sender of the transaction, in part or full. For example, a Company B receives 100 units of an item from a Company A and may wish to return all or some of the items while paying for the rest of items to Company A. Company B initiates the return as two different transactions, one of goods and the other as payment  for accounts to be reconciled with full settlement of quantities, amount and tax.</p>
          </div>
          <div data-w-tab="Tab 3" class="process-tab-pane w-tab-pane">
            <p>A “<strong>Split</strong>” transaction is one during which an operating node splits a single input transaction into two or more nodes with multiple attributes. For example, Company A receives 100 units of an item and then splits them into two batches of 50 each and sends each of the batches to two downstream buyers. The reconciliation requires Company A to receive payments from both the buyers and reconcile accounts with its bank transactions as well as buyers.</p>

          <div data-w-tab="Tab 4" class="process-tab-pane w-tab-pane w--tab-active">
            <p>A “<strong>Merge</strong>” transaction is one in which the operating node merges multiple transactions received into a single transaction and sends it to the next recipient. For example, a Manufacturer receives 100 sets of five components from five different vendors to manufacture 100 units of a finished product, thus “merging” the components into one unit each and sends them to the next stakeholder in the value chain.</p>

      <p>Incumbent upon the transaction, reconciliation would be required on attributes like quantity, rate, amount and tax applicable on all 3. <br>‍<strong>Forward</strong> and <strong>Return</strong> Transaction will handle all tagged attributes for reconciliation along with any value addition. In addition, the transaction ownership now changes to the initiator of the Forward or Return and the receivers cannot modify the transaction until they operate upon it. The reconciliation requires the First party to receive goods and services along with related documents such as invoices, vouchers, orders from the second party. The First party may then make payments through the bank to the second party which will need to be reconciled for settlement. On the other hand, the First Party may pay, return or reverse inventories in part or in full, requiring him to reconcile inventories, corresponding payments, taxes, and other expenses with payments through the bank where reconciliation may become slightly difficult to track, especially if its spread out over time. A Forward or Return will require a pair of ledgers for each party along with reconciliation by both parties with their respective banks and statutory filings such as GST.</p>
      <p>A<strong> Merge or Split</strong> requires at least three pairs of ledgers to be reconciled, in addition to their respective banks and statutory filings such as GST and multiple ledgers for the goods in transit, which are to be reconciled. With Aurigraph DLT, all of the above can be achieved through API integrations with their respective sources, thereby reducing manual intervention and Operational effort and cost significantly for administration, accounting and audit.<br></p>
